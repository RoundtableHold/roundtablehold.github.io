title: " TL;DR All NPC Quest Steps in Order"
id: quest_order_tldr
description: "These Steps are a TL;DR Version and will not explain how to get anywhere, only where to go. They will also follow the order of \"Intended\" Route and as such, will complete every questline in that order. That said, if I were to completely go with what I believed was \"Intended\", several questlines wouldn't be completed at all. Therefore, I will instead complete every questline with the \"best\" ending, that is to say I will try for happy endings whenever possible. If you are looking for specific results to questlines, please try the NPC Questlines section instead."

description: "These Steps are a TL;DR Version and will not explain how to get anywhere, only where to go. They will also follow the order of \"Intended\" Route and as such, will complete every questline in that order. That said, if I were to completely go with what I believed was \"Intended\", several questlines wouldn't be completed at all. Therefore, I will instead complete every questline with the \"best\" ending, that is to say I will try for happy endings whenever possible. If you are looking for specific results to questlines, please try the NPC Questlines section instead."
