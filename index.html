                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_1">Once you have left the tutorial area, talk to White-Faced Varre nearby then head North-West to the Church of Elleh and talk to Kale. Continue North to the fork in the road and grab the Grace to your West and the Grace to your East. Rest at the Grace to your East. From now on, rest often and look for the "Talk to" option in the Grace menu when resing</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_2">Head East and find a talking tree. Hit or roll into the tree to break the illusion and find Boc. Head North from there, through a small camp of enemies and go North, up through the hills to find Alexander then make your way down to grab the Grace.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_3">Go back to the starting grace and go West and downhill to the beach. In the side of the cliff North-West on the beach will be a cave where you can find Boc again. Go through or don't then go back to the Grace where you found Alexander.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_4">Head East across the bridge to find a man mourning over a dead body beside the road. Head South and West to find a Spiritjump (horse-jump) at the bottom of a ravine containing a stream. Jump down onto that Spiritjump to avoid damage and head South. After the fight, talk to Yura nearby then head into the cave by the campfire.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_5">Deep in the cave is a boss. At half-health, he will ask for mercy. If spared, reload and go back to boss room. Reload and go back again, opening the chest this time.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_6">Head just South-East until you hear some howling then head North back to the road to find a man named Kenneth on top of some ruins. Head South-East, through the forest to Fort Haight in the South-East Corner. Explore Fort Haight to get one half of the Dectus Medallion.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_7">Return to Kenneth then go back to the Church of Elleh where Kale is. Wait until nightfall at the Grace and talk to Renna nearby, then Kale to get the Fingersnap Emote.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_8">Return to the forest, where you heard the howling and use Fingersnap nearby to meet Blaidd. After talking to him, go to Fort Haight and talk to Kenneth then go back to the Grace West of that fork in the road, North of the game's start and head West through the gate.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_9">Follow the path until you reach Stormhill Shack and talk to Roderika a few times then continue North. Don't follow the path, instead go through the forest to find a broken bridge. There is a path there you can choose to take but know that it will skip parts of some questlines.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_10">You may now safely explore all of Limgrave except for Stormveil Castle without breaking anything, provided you don't go down the giant elevator near the Minor Erdtree in the Eastern forest(It's called the Siofra River Well), use any Waygates or allow yourself to get caught in any trapped chests like the one in the cave that you opened earlier. Everything else is safe.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_11">Here are some notable people and places.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_12">Knight Bernahl can be found in Warmaster's Shack on the road East of Stormhill Shack.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_13">North of Warmaster's Shack is a Coliseum with an Invader.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_14">East of the lake in Limgrave is the Waypoint Ruins. Under them is Sorceress Sellen</li>

Blaidd will be available for you to summon if you wish. Defeat the enemy and talk to Blaidd then go down the slope.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_2_2">Cross the bridge and talk to Irina on the roadside then keep heading South.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_2_3">You can safely explore this whole area, minus Waygates and trapped chests that teleport you, without breaking anything.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_2_4">Once you're finished, go to Castle Morne in the deep South and go through the castle to find Edgar on the Ramparts. Talk to him then continue through the castle and fight the boss(Edgar is available to summon).</li>

              <ul class="collapse in" id="swimming_in_the_lake_col">
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_1">So nearby should be a few NPCs depending on your choices, interact with them if you wish then head North-West down the slope to the Lake. Go North-West from here to find an island with an old friend on it, follow his instructions to go East to find a girl named Rya if you wish and if you choose to help her, go North-West to find the man she seeks.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_2">Whatever your choice, head North to the Academy Gate Town and explore the area to find Diallos with his friend.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_3">From here, explore the whole zone to your hearts content but a few warnings. Don't take the Coward's Path just yet. You'll know it by the name Ruin-Strewn Precipice. And don't go down the Ainsel River Well in the North-East. Waygates and trapped chests SHOULD be fine to take. I can't think of any that aren't.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_4">When you are finished exploring, go West of Raya Lucaria if you haven't already and grab the Glintstone Key from nearby the Dragon found there. Take it to one of the seals blocking off the academy, the closest one is North-East of Raya Lucaria on top of a broken bridge. Use the key on the seal and enter the academy.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_5">Explore the academy to your hearts content. Remember the information that the old friend gave you about the Iron Virgin below the Academy and try to avoid going down that elevator just yet. To explain, try not to let the Iron Virgin eat you. It won't necessarily break anything but I don't believe it's part of the game's "intended" path and you will be in hot lava if you do it.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_6">Besides that, explore the academy to your heart's content and eventually kill the boss and go back to Roundtable Hold. You should now have "permission" to go up the Grand Lift.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_7">Before we leave the lake though, here's a couple of things we need to do to get to other areas later.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_8">In the North-West section of the map is Caria Manor and South of it is a Giant named Iji. Go through Caria Manor and then North-West to find Ranni's Rise. This begins Ranni's Questline and leads to one of the big 3 endings. Seluvis is in the tower South of Ranni's Rise and has another questline.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_9">Along the cliffs in the South section of the map is the entrance to a town. Nepheli will be on the road here on a bunch of corpses(may require reloading the area/resting at a Grace before she appears) and in the town is a very very large pot. Try rolling into it to meet Albus and acquire the first half of the Haligtree Medallion.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_10">East of the town, also along the cliffs, is a cave. Go all the way through it and past the boss room to find Latenna. If you met Albus she will be more talkative.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_11">Revenger's Shack in the West section of the zone will have an invasion with an important item for a questline.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_12">In some ruins on the shore in the South-East will be an NPC who will appear again on the broken bridge to the East of Raya Lucaria and again in the church past the broke bridge in the North section of the map.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_13">At the Main Gate of Raya Lucaria, just to the North will be a summon sign that lets you continue Yura's Questline.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_14">In the South-West of Raya Lucaria will be the Rose Church where White-Faced Varre will be with his questline. Note: He thinks fingers are gross.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_15">At the East section of Lake Liurnia is Jarburg, remember this area for Diallos and Alexander's Quests. In it is Jar-bairn quest.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_5_3">Here are things NOT to do. Don't enter Redmane Castle in the South-East yet(that means no touching the Waygates on the bridge nearby it also be wary of the Waygate in Fort Gaol in the South-West corner.

                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_5_4">Once you've finished you're exploration go to the Shack of the Rotting Grace back in the North-West corner. Go North-East to the cliffs and follow along them to eventually find a path to jump over to the other side. This is a more dangerous area to explore but head East, avoiding the wildlife, and if you follow the road going East you should eventually see a massive Dragon. Run past it to the left and get to the Fort Faroth Grace. Explore Fort Faroth to get the other half of the Dectus Medallion.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="playthrough_7_2">The way you'll know if the area is ready is that at the bridge near the castle you will find 2 Waygates, one on either side of the bridge. If you can use them, you can do the fight. Otherwise go to the next section and come back after.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_3_2">Go to Coastal Cave, on the shore West of the games start and talk to him inside a few times. Kill the boss of Coastal Cave and talk to him again to give him the Sewing Needle.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_3_3">Meet him next to the the Lake-Facing Cliffs Grace, North of Stormveil Castle and talk to him and he will start altering your clothes for you.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_3_4">He will appear again at a few different Sites of Grace but doesn't do anything.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_3_5">Grab the Gold Sewing Needle from the Church of Vows on the East side of Liurnia Lake. Eventually you'll meet Boc at the East Capital Rampart in Leyndell Royal Capital.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_3_6">You have to buy a piece of boss gear from Enia and then you will be given the option to give him the Gold Sewing Needle. Later he will mention his ugly appearance and ask your thoughts on it.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li data-id="npc_quests_3_7_1">He will mention Rennala and ask for a Larval Tear to go change himself. If you choose to give it to him, he will show up at Rennala's boss room as a human, then when reloaded he will be dead.</li>
                  <li data-id="npc_quests_3_7_2">Alternatively, if you go to Hermit Village, located South-East of Volcano Manor and most easily reached by going through the "Coward's Way" to reach Mt. Gelmir, you will find Prattling-Pate: You're Beautiful on the South side of the village. Take that and use it next to Boc in East Capital Rampart and then talk to him. He will mention hearing his mother's voice and ask if you feel the same. If you agree then he will be happy with his appearance.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_3_8">Notes: Do not talk to Boc in East Capital Rampart until you have the Prattling-Pate: You're Beautiful. Otherwise, he may disappear forever.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_7_5">Corhyn and Goldmask can later be found in Leyndell on a hill near West Capital Rampart. Talk to them and then get the Golden Order Principia near the Erdtree Sanctuary Grace(South-East of West Capital Rampart) by going up a root, through the door, and jumping onto a roof before circling the building and climbing another root.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_7_7">Later, travel to the Stargazer's Ruins in the North section of the Mountaintops of the Giants, located on the North-Eastern corner of the map and talk to them.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_23_2">Find him again, by the southwestern entrance to the Village if you haven't unlocked Roundtable Hold yet, or sitting at the Roundtable itself if you have.

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_23_3">Get to the Bestial Sanctum and meet Gurranq, most simply by using the portal D marked for you, then return to D. Tell him yes and he'll sell you a few incantations.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_23_4">Once you end up with the Weathered Dagger from Fia, take it to D. He'll be grateful that you found it, and he'll know just who to take it to.</li>

                  <li data-id="npc_quests_24_2_2">If Fia killed D in Roundtable Hold, progress won't come until after you've defeated Lichdragon Fortissax in Fia's questline. Afterwards, travel back to Fia's location in Deeproot Depths to find that D's brother has gotten his revenge. Exhaust his dialogue and reload the area to find him gone, having left the armor and sword behind; alternatively, you can initiate a fight for your own revenge for Fia, and get the loot by killing him.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_12_2">Go to the Avenue Balcony Grace in the Center of Leyndell Royal Capital and find a Well to the North-West in a ruined area nearby the Lower Capital Church Grace. Go down the Well to enter the Sewers.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_12_3">Go through until you reach the Underground Roadside Grace. Go out the door, turn left, run past the big guy and go down a large open grate on the left side before reaching the gate. Once you fall in, go down the path, not into the sewer pipe tunnel, and you'll see multiple giant flowers. Run past the flowers and up the ladder to find the room with a bunch of Giant Hands. Kill the hands and then open the nearby door with the Sewer-Gaol Key to find Dung-Eater.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_12_4">Talk to him then go back to where he was in Roundtable Hold to find a message. Go to outer moat on the North side of the Leyndell Royal Capital, outside the city walls, and he will spawn as an Invader. If he doesn't, it means that Blackguard Big Boggart is there and you should talk to him, buy some Boiled Crab, talk some more, reload the area, and talk to him again to collect a Seedbed Curse. When walking away, Dung-Eater should invade.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_12_5">Kill him and go back to the him in Roundtable Hold. Go to his real body and depending on if you've progressed Seluvis' Questline, you get a choice.</li>

                  <li data-id="npc_quests_12_5_1">The default choice is to give his body Seedbed Curses and once you given him 5, you get the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse for another ending to the game.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_26_1">Irina's father. He's a bit hidden in Castle Morne, but it's semi-important to find him before killing the boss, or else the quest progression can get confused. Go up the lift and past the courtyard with the large mount of bodies and enemies and a sleeping Pumpkin Head. Climb the ladder in the back up to the ramparts. Follow the ramparts across a narrower section and slash at a pile of boxes on the left side, where you'll find a ladder poking up. Descend and go past the fighting enemies and up the spiral stairs beyond them. Finally, you should see Edgar sitting on a bench.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_26_2">Deliver him Irina's Letter, and he'll say that as much as he'd like to leave, he can't yet, and you should go tell Irina that he'll come when he can. Don't bother; you can't actually tell her anything yet. More importantly, he tells you he can't leave because the Castle and its special sword are in peril. That's something you can fix.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_26_3">Go finish Castle Morne. Upon killing the boss, the Leonine Misbegotten, it drops the Grafted Blade Greatsword.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_26_4">Time to run all the way back to Edgar. Show him you saved the sword, and he'll be so relieved he won't even ask for it back. He'll say he's going back to Irina.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_26_5">Now go back to Irina. Edgar should be beside her. He curses his own inaction and vows vengeance against whoever did this.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_26_6">There's no way to know who killed Irina, but apparently, Edgar thinks it was you. A bit later in the game, you'll find a place called the Revenger's Shack in Liurnia. As soon as you light the Site of Grace, he'll invade your world as Edgar the Revenger and try to kill you. Defeat him for his Banished Knight's Halberd +8 and a Shabriri Grape for Hyetta. This invasion happens even if you didn't do the rest of his questline at all, and, even more wildly, even if you killed him at one of his previous locations.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_26_7">Notes: The game wiki reports that this questline is mildly bugged in a few spots.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li data-id="npc_quests_26_7_1">If you kill the Leonine Misbegotten before finding Edgar and showing him the letter, even if you've since found Irina's dead body, once you do find Edgar, the interaction still plays out exactly as detailed in the second step above, with no way to show him the sword or tell him about Irina. You'll have to fast travel away and make your way back to Edgar, at least once if not twice, before he'll notice the sword and agree to leave.</li>
                  <li data-id="npc_quests_26_7_2">When he invades you at the Revenger's Shack, if you leave without successfully killing him and then return later, he may not come back at all. The wiki reports this as a bug with no known workaround yet.</li>

Agree, and you'll literally lose 1 point off your Vigor stat, and the HP that goes with it, in exchange for a consumable called Baldachin's Blessing. Use this consumable at any time to receive a 15 second buff to poise and physical damage negation, after which you also get your point of Vigor back.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_22_2">While cuddling with her, sometimes it ends automatically after a few seconds, but sometimes you stay and get a prompt to talk to her. Use 'Talk in secret' to learn more about her. If you've gotten far enough in Rogier's questline, there'll be a prompt for her to tell you about the Black Knifeprint and hand you the Knifeprint Clue map. Once you've given the Knifeprint to Rogier, there's a new option for which she'll give you a Sacrificial Twig.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_22_3">After you've reached the Altus Plateau, go get more cuddles and select the new dialogue option 'May I ask a favor?' She'll give you the Weathered Dagger and ask you to find who it belongs to. The next time you talk to D, he'll take it from you, informing you that he knows who it belongs to. Convenient!</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_22_4">But not for D. Rest and he should be gone. Go check out the blacksmith's hall and you'll find that the door at the end is newly opened. See what Fia has done, and talk to her until she teleports away.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_22_5">Way later, at the height of the Deeproot Depths by the Across the Roots Site of Grace, you'll find Fia's Champions, a boss fight against waves of red phantom NPC fighters randomized in a way similar to the Giant Jar's. Defeat them, and you'll get Fia's Mist.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_22_6">Rest at the new Prince of Death's Throne Site of Grace. Fia should appear in the boss room. Get held, and she'll ask you to find the Cursemark of Death, the same thing Rogier sought before his own death.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_22_7">Bring it to her and she'll give you a Radiant Baldachin's Blessing, similar to the standard variant without the HP penalty. Exhaust her dialogue and rest, and like Rogier, she'll have fallen asleep. This time, though, inspect her slumbering form and you can enter her dreams, where you'll find a hidden boss essential to one of the game's endings. Defeat it for the Mending Rune of the Death-Prince.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_22_8">After this, if you gave D's armor set to his brother and didn't kill D yourself, the next time you return to Fia, you'll find he's donned the armor and killed her, and you can loot her armor set.</li>

He'll advise you on a much safer way into the castle than the bombartment of ballista bolts you'll receive if you go through the gate, but you still get a dialogue choice to agree or disagree. If you ask him to, now or later, he'll open the gate for you, though it's much safer to go the long way around as he advises and open it yourself from inside.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_27_2">As you progress either path, Gostoc will secretly be close behind. You may notice that while in Stormveil Castle, if you die and then retrieve your runes, you don't get them all back - Gostoc steals 30% from every retrieval you drop in the castle. At any time until you kill Godrick, you can kill Gostoc and get those stolen souls back, though of course you end Gostoc's questline early by doing so. Killing Godrick makes them lost forever.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_27_3">At a few different points as you explore Stormveil, you can actually catch him sneaking around behind you. He's hard to spot, but the wiki reports that you can find him 'on a ruined watchtower on the side path, inside the rampart tower, and on the castle chapel roof, above Sorcerer Rogier.'

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_27_6">After defeating Godrick, Gostoc will appear in the boss arena to vent his pent-up frustrations. For now, his shop is closed.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_27_7">Later in the game, after defeating Morgott and progressing Nepheli and Kenneth's questlines, both of them plus Gostoc move into Godrick's Throne Room. Gostoc's shop is finally open again, and now he sells a coveted Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone as a reward for your self-restraint in not murdering him.</li>

              <ul class="collapse in" id="hyetta_col">
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_28_1">Find Hyetta right at the start of Liurnia by the Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace. She'll ask for a Shabriri Grape. If you went through Stormveil Castle rather than around it, you probably just found one - right before emerging into Liurnia, you pass through Godrick's elaborate throne room area, where a Ghost gives you one. (You can even go backwards into this building from the Liurnia side if you skipped Godrick.) Give this to her and she'll give you the As You Wish gesture.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_28_2">She'll next show up directly west of the Purified Ruins a little farther north into Liurnia. She'll ask for another Shabriri Grape. There's again one right nearby, in the Purified Ruins themselves, in a boarded up basement that you need to break into with a roll, an attack, or just by walking over it with Torrent. Give it to her and she'll again be grateful.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_28_3">Her next location is by the Gate Town Bridge Site of Grace. She wants, you guessed it, a Shabriri Grape. There's only one left, and this time, it's nowhere near here - it's all the way on the other side of the lake, roughly in a straight horizontal line from here toward west, at the Revenger's Shack, where you should receive one as a drop from NPC invader Edgar the Revenger. (Check the notes under Edgar's quest above for information about a reported bug that may impact this.)</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_28_4">Give Hyetta this third grape and she'll ask a dangerous question that by now you may have gleaned the answer to. Tell her the truth, and she'll react in horror, and you can listen to her vomit the grape back up as you walk away. Before you leave, rest at the nearby grace and then exhaust her dialogue again. She seems to have figured out something important thanks to you.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_28_5">You'll find her again at Bellum Church, even farther north into Liurnia. Surprisingly, she doesn't want another Shabriri Grape, as they aren't enough for her anymore. Now she wants a Fingerprint Grape. Thankfully this is nearby again, in the Church of Inhibition a bit to the east, where it'll drop from NPC invader Festering Fingerprint Vyke. Hand it over, and she'll devour it right in front of you, excitedly claiming she's sure now she'll fulfill her mission to become a Finger Maiden.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_28_6">Her final location is a very far distance from her tour of Liurnia so far: the Frenzied Flame Proscription Site of Grace. Her questline can only be completed at this stage by locking yourself into the Lord of Frenzied Flame ending of the game, so be forewarned. If you accept the flame from the Three Fingers, go talk to her about it and watch what happens. In the end, she'll give you the Frenzied Flame Seal.</li>

On top you'll find Kenneth, dramatically staring into the middle distance. Entertain his classism until he asks a favor of you - he has a fort, Fort Haight in fact, in the southeast, and it's been taken over by knights of Stormveil. You see where this is going.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_30_4">Meet him back at his fort to find the enemies here have changed, but it's still not exactly safe. Kenneth will be where the Godrick Knight was, and he'll tell you forlornly that he can't knight you yet. He needs a new Lord of Limgrave.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_30_5">Way, way, way later in the game, after killing Morgott the Omen King, if you've gotten Nepheli's questline far enough, he'll select her as this Lord. They'll show up in Godrick's Throne Room. Talk to Kenneth to complete the questline, where he'll talk proudly of Nepheli, and assure you that soon enough, he'll go back to his fort and knight you. One of these days.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_17_7">To continue to progress, you must have gotten Roderika's questline far enough that she's a Spirit Tuner. You'll also need a Key item called Stormhawk King. Go to the Four-Belfries in western Liurnia. There you will find 3 locked Waygates and a single Imbued Sword Key. Use it on the Gate that mentions Anticipation. (If you've used the key already on a different Gate, there are two more to find for the other Gates, one in Raya Lucaria and one in Sellia, Town of Sorcery.) This will return you to where the game started. Go through the area, get your revenge, and find the Stormhawk King around the chapel where you first spawned. You'll notice it looks like a Spirit Ash, but it 'refuses to answer anyone's summons.'</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_17_8">Give the Stormhawk King to Nepheli. She can't do anything with it, but she'll be reminded of her first hawk and find some hope again.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_17_9">Make sure you've gotten Kenneth's questline far enough that he's standing around in Fort Haight, intending to search for a new Lord of Limgrave. If you have, you're done for now until you beat Morgott, the Omen King.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_17_10">Head back to Godrick's throne room after beating Morgott. It's just past the Site of Grace he left behind back in Stormveil. Getting the next step to trigger can be a bit buggy, and you may need to rest at the grace a couple times while you're here. Eventually, Nepheli, Kenneth, and Gatekeeper Gostoc should all appear in the throne room. Kenneth has evidently found his Lord of Limgrave, and Nepheli will gift you an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone in thanks for getting her this far.</li>

Open that chest and get ambushed by Patches, boss bar and all, as he attacks you for stealing from him. Get his health down to about half, and he'll immediately drop to his knees and surrender, which you can 'accept' by not attacking for a few seconds. This gives you a few Rune items and the gesture he's doing. Exhaust his dialogue.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_29_2">Rest and make your way back to his room to find his shop up and running, where he sells some good stuff, including a valuable cookbook. There's also a new chest in the room you can ask him about. He'll warn you not to steal. Open it anyway for a laugh; you'll get caught in a teleporter trap that uniquely you can't roll away from, and he'll laugh at you as you get taken deep into Mistwood Ruins surrounded by a bunch of huge bears. Have fun.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_29_8">Head back to his location again and he'll belittle your harrowing experience, giving you another gesture as well.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_29_9">Still in Murkwater Cave, while he's sitting there in front of you, a humble merchant, give in to your desires and start wailing on him again. Aggro him, but this time, let him whittle down your health rather than the other way around. He'll recognize the parallel and give you yet another gesture, one of Extreme Repentance, and tell you to use it; if you do, the fight will again end and all will be well.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_29_3">Once in Liurnia, he'll set up at the Scenic Isle Site of Grace. He'll give you a piece of advice if you ask - he'll inform you about an Iron Virgin deep at the bottom of the water wheel in Raya Lucaria, and he claims that if you let it kill you by trapping you in its chest, it'll transport you right to the base of the Erdtree.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li data-id="npc_quests_29_3_1">Feel free to give it a shot while you're in Raya Lucaria. There is indeed a lone Iron Virgin where he says it'll be, and it will indeed transport you if you die to its grab attack, though you may end up somewhere a bit less idyllic than he claims.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_29_10">Whenever you fight Scarscourge Radahn, feel free to summon Patches to help out. He'll spawn in and then immediately dip out.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_29_4">Missable: His next new location is near the First Mt. Gelmir Campfire Site of Grace. Follow the cliff edge westward until you reach the corner, and you may find a message he's left for unsuspecting wanderers, as well as a trail of Rainbow Stones. You can find him nearby, squatting in a bush. He'll tell you he's not doing anything suspicious (clearly), but that even so, you should totally check out what those Rainbow Stones are leading to. In true Patches fashion, it's time to wander to a tall ledge and let the cutscene play out. Note how he proclaims you'll never join Volcano Manor - if you join Volcano Manor before this interaction, you'll miss it entirely, and it'd be such a shame to miss Patches doing what he does best.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_29_5">Once you do join Volcano Manor, you'll find him inside. He's surprised to see you, but he reopens his shop to you.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_29_6">After you do any assassination request for Volcano Manor, he'll give you one himself with the Letter to Patches. Kill the target and return to him, and he'll tell you he needs to report back to Tanith. Rest and talk to him again, and he'll bitterly reward you with the Magma Whip Candlestick. He'll stay there until you beat the boss.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_29_7">You'll last find him before the boss of the Shaded Castle. He'll give you the Dancer's Castanets. Weirdly, if you do even a single point of damage to him here, he'll simply die. If you don't and you reload the area, he'll be gone, possibly dead anyway.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_19_1">First encountered during Ranni's questline as a spirit. To do this, go through Caria Manor in North-West Liurnia Lake and go North-West of that to get to Ranni's Rise. Talk to Ranni and join her (if you already are helping Rogier, you'll have to go back to him then come back to join her)</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_19_2">After joining her go downstairs and talk to the spirits then back upstairs to Ranni. DO NOT give the Fingerslayer Blade to Ranni. Once you do, Seluvis dies.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_19_3">Seluvis can now be found in his tower South-East of Ranni's Rise. He will give you a potion to turn someone into a puppet, and he'll ask you to give it to Nepheli, but there are other options for it as well. You can also now buy Sorceries from him. The choice is here.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li data-id="npc_quests_19_3_1">If you give it to Nepheli, you will make Seluvis happy and get the Nepheli Loux Puppet later from his dead body.</li>
                  <li data-id="npc_quests_19_3_3">If you give it to Dung Eater at the end of his questline instead of the Seedbed Curse, then you can buy a Dung Eater Puppet from Seluvis.</li>
                  <li data-id="npc_quests_19_3_2">If you give it to Gideon, he'll dispose of it. Seluvis doesn't find out, no one is killed by it, and the questline still advances, though you won't get a fancy puppet of one of your friends.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_19_4">Go North of his tower, into the ruins and find an Illusory Floor in one that leads down to a room full of Seluvis' Puppets. Roll into the door in the back to reveal an Illusory Wall. Go back to Seluvis and bring up the room, and he will give you a free puppet.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_19_5">After you buy all Sorceries and get your first puppet, he will let you in on his scheme. He wants you to find the Amber Starlight Shard located North-East of the Atlus Highway Junction Grace, North-East of the Grand Lift of Dectus, in a canyon filled with Krakens.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_19_6">Bring the Amber Starlight Shard and give it to him to receive the Magic Scorpion Charm. He will then give you a potion to give to Ranni. If you do it, then she will wake up angry at you, then kill you and Seluvis. Seluvis also dies after giving the Fingerslayer Blade to Ranni and continuing her quest.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_19_7">If you give the potion to Ranni and make her mad, you can absolve yourself at the Church of Vows to fix her questline, but I recommend just not giving her the potion. After his death his corpse will sell you puppets for Starlight Shards.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_2_5">As you progress in the story, while Roderika grows more attached to him and hopes he'll find freedom, Hewg begins to fade. His dialogue grows wearier and becomes obsessed with the mission he was given to kill a god. He'll comment on that when you upgrade a weapon to max, and at other times he may berate himself that his work isn't good enough. By the time the Erdtree burns, he'll forget everything except how to smith, and if you ask him about himself, he'll ask if you know who he is, who you are, and why that girl weeps for him.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_21_2">Defeat the lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit in the depths of Stormveil (from the Liftside Chamber grace, without taking the lift, go out the main doorway and drop off the nearby ledge with a dangling corpse for some fall damage, or, if you've unlocked the one-way door in the grace room, drop down the many platforms just beyond it and take no damage if you're careful). Past the monster, opposite a ladder leading back up into Stormveil, is a large decayed face on the ground, and near it, a bloodstain not left by any player. View it to watch what Rogier's been up to - if you've fought any Black Knife Assassins yet, you may recognize this animation.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_21_3">After defeating Godrick, Rogier comes to Roundtable Hold, sitting on the balcony overlooking the entrance hall with NPC invader Mad Tongue Alberich. Chat with him to learn about his new circumstances, tell him you've defeated Godrick for Rogier's Rapier +8, and ask about what you found beneath Stormveil to advance his questline. He'll tell you Godwyn lore and warn you to stay away from any Black Blades.</li>

                </ul>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_21_4">Time to ignore his advice and go find a Black Blade. Go to Black Knife Catacombs, either by finding it on your own, or by getting some cuddles with Fia after that conversation with Rogier: you should newly be able to ask her about the Black Knifeprint, and she'll share some knowledge about it and hand you a minimap as a location clue. Either way, fight the dungeon's secret second boss, a Black Knife Assassin. It'll drop the Black Knifeprint.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_21_5">Take it to Rogier and he'll enthusiastically request to study it and not give you a chance to say no. Go rest at the table and immediately talk to him again, and he'll give it back and point you toward Ranni. You can ask him more about this if you like, but he wants the cursemark of death that Ranni bears.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_21_6">Go find Ranni at Ranni's Rise at the northern tip of Liurnia, after Caria Manor. Exhaust her dialogue and you'll learn her current body is a doll, while the cursemark remains on her original flesh body. She'll send you away. Go back to Rogier and he'll tell you to try serving her in order to uncover her body's whereabouts. Go back to Ranni and she'll accept.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_21_7">Unfortunately, while Rogier has managed to set you off on Ranni's questline, wherein you can indeed find the cursemark, there's no way for him to live that long. As soon as you've become one of Ranni's vassals as he advised, returning to him and Talking will reveal he's drifting away. Rest at the table, and he'll already be asleep. Warp to Roundtable Hold again, even from within it, and he'll be dead, leaving behind his Bell Bearing, his entire outfit, and a letter, which goes into the Info tab of your inventory and gives you a hint regarding D's questline. Rest one more time, and he'll be gone entirely.</li>

                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_10_3">Go back to Sellen. Then head to Sellian Hideaway in North Caelid past the seals in Sellia and North of the Church of the Plague Grace. It is hidden behind an Illusory wall behind a giant gravestone.</li>
                <li class="" data-id="npc_quests_10_4">Go through Sellia Hideaway and at the bottom you will find a seal guarded by a sorceror. Kill him and open the seal then talk to Master Lusat and defeat Radahn in Redmane Castle then return to Sellen.</li>

There is no 'right time' to use the medal; you can use it instantly and it will warp you to the steps of Mohgwyn Palace. Varre says to wait because he hopes for 'Luminary' Mohg to become king and for you to meet him as such. On a metatextual level, the devs had him say that because Mohgwyn Palace is a VERY hard area that dumps you right in front of the Mohg boss fight, all best left for much later than Liurnia. Use the medal when you're ready, or if you just want to grab the nearby Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance Site of Grace and dip out.</li>

<h3>Welcome to the Roundtable Tracker</h3>
<p>The comprehensive tracker for Elden Ring, made by completionists, for completionists.</p>
<p>This site is still a work in-progress. We are working on it every day.</p>

<h3>I have feedback, how can I contribute?</h3>
<p>You can visit the <a href="https://github.com/Roundtable-Hold/tracker">GitHub repository</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Roundtable-Hold/tracker/issues">report Issues</a> or create a fork and submit a Pull Request.</p>
<p>You can also reach out to Azy on reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/azy2/">/u/azy2</a> or Discord Azy#9592 or reach out to Quivorian on reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/quivorian">/u/quivorian</a> or Discord: Quivorian#6564</p>

<h3>Can I use this for multiple characters?</h3>
<p>Yup, use the profile selector and buttons in the options tab at the top of the page to setup multiple profiles.</p>

<h3>How does the checklist status get saved?</h3>
<p>The checklist is saved to your browser's local storage. Be careful when clearing your browser's cache as it will also destroy your saved progress.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>This sheet would not be possible without the incredible work already done by the team at Fextralife, the team behind MapGenie, fellow redditors /u/Athrek and /u/AcceptablePackMule, and the rest of the community.</p>
<p>The foundation of this website was based on <a href="https://github.com/ZKjellberg">ZKjellberg</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/ZKjellberg/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet">Dark Soul's 3 Cheat Sheet</a> source code.</p>

<h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>
<p>This tracker is still a work in progress, and as such, we apologize for any issues that might come about as we update the checklist and iron out bugs.</p>
<p>We will do our best to ensure that such issues remain few and far between.</p>
